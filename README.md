# Azure App Service Authentication / Authorization (Easy Auth)
This repository is intended for public-facing documentation, samples, and issue tracking for Azure App Service Authentication / Authorization.

Documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cgillum/easyauth/wiki).

## What is Easy Auth? ##

Authentication / Authorization (which I’ll refer to as **Easy Auth** throughout this repository) is a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to easily integrate a variety of auth capabilities into your web app or API. It’s built directly into the platform and doesn’t require any particular languages, SDKs, security expertise, or even any code to utilize. This is why we call it *easy* – anybody can leverage it, even non-developers, with just a few clicks in the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
